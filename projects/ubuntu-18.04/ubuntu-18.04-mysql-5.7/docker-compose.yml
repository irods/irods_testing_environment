    # Our preferred choice character set encoding and collation scheme is UTF-8, as shown below,
    # but attempting to use those results in an iRODS setup error. The error is caused by a table
    # exceeding the maximum row size allowed by MySQL.

    # To get around this, we use latin1_general_cs. Using this option keeps the row size within
    # the allowed range and makes queries case sensitive (this is required for proper use of iRODS).
